        "answer": "The first image describes a white Audi parked on the right side, facing the camera in what seems to be a residential or commercial parking lot with a bright light source visible. The second image also describes a white Audi in similar positioning but with mixed concrete and gravel ground, indistinct shapes and lights in the background, suggesting a less defined area but still likely a parking lot. The third image describes a more residential setting with the white Audi parked in a driveway bordered by a brick wall and a grassy area, with residential surroundings visible. Hence, the first and second images could describe a commercial parking lot due to the general parking lot elements, while the third image depicts a residential property.",
