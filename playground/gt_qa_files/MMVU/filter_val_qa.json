        "answer_number": 1,
        "candidates": [
            "A. The speedometer will read a higher speed than the actual speed because the larger wheels cause the cable to rotate faster.",
            "B. The speedometer will display the same speed as before, but the actual vehicle speed will be higher for the same reading due to the increased wheel circumference.",
            "C. The speedometer will automatically adjust and display the correct speed despite the wheel size change.",
            "D. The speedometer will malfunction because the larger wheels disrupt the magnetic interaction within the speedometer.",
