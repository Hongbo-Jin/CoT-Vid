        "question": "Individuals diagnosed with cancer often experience significant amounts of\nstress. Some patients cope with stress by adopting unhealthy habits (like\ndrinking, smoking, or withdrawing from social relationships), which can\nincrease symptom severity and result in poor quality of life both during and\nafter cancer treatment. Conversely, individuals who manage stress with\nhealthy techniques can experience symptom relief and improved quality of\nlife. A group of oncologists hope to promote healthy stress reduction and\ndecide to focus their efforts on deep breathing. They postulate that a deep\nbreathing exercise will induce the relaxation response, a physical state of\ndeep rest that is the physiological opposite of a stress response (or fight\nor flight). They believe that when patients learn to breathe more slowly and\ndeeply, their muscles will relax, blood pressure will decrease, and heart\nrates will slow down (all characteristics of the relaxation response). When\ntesting the exercise with two patients they notice significant decreases in\nblood pressure, muscle tension, and heart rate. They conclude that the\nexercise could decrease select physical symptoms of stress. The oncologists\ndecide to expand their testing, and develop several deep-breathing exercises to\nbe delivered in a group format. They believe that the combined exercises will\nhelp patients cope during times of stress. The program consists of 30-minute\nguided group breathing classes that occur biweekly for 8 weeks. Patients are\nalso asked to complete home deep breathing practices. To test their theory,\nthey recruit 10 adult cancer patients to participate in their program. The\npatient group is homogenous in type and stage of cancer. All patients have\nrecently received their cancer diagnosis. The patients are all between 45 and\n55 years old (mean age 48.6) and there are equal numbers of men and women in\nthe group. Each patient completes a stress symptom checklist both before and\nafter the intervention. The stress symptoms checklist can be found in Table\n1. The symptom checklist is divided into four categories, with six possible\nsymptoms in each category. Patients are instructed to circle any and all\nsymptoms they are currently experiencing. The results from the study can be\nfound in Figure 1 <image 1>. Which coping strategy best describes the\ndeep breathing program?",
