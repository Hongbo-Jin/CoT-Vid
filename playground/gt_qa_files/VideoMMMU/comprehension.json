For a learned behaviour to be produced, the individual must be able to reproduce it and must be motivated to do so.\n4.

Money is considered a primary reinforcer because it has innate reinforcing qualities.\n4. A job promotion is an example of a secondary reinforcer.\n5.

Identify which statements are correct.\nScenarios:\n\\bullet Maria struggles with a fear of public speaking. According to her, this fear stems from unresolved conflicts during her childhood, which she is not consciously aware of.\n\\bullet Tom often procrastinates and performs poorly in his academic work. He attributes his struggles to his negative thoughts about his own abilities.\n\\bullet Lisa is working on personal growth and aims to achieve her full potential. She seeks to improve her self-esteem through various self-help strategies.\n\\bullet Jason is highly competitive and believes that his competitive nature helps him secure resources and succeed in his endeavors.\nStatements:\n1. A researcher studying the influence of neurotransmitter imbalances on bipolar disorder is working from the biological perspective.\n2. According to the biological perspective, Maria's inability to overcome her fear of public speaking is primarily due to her unresolved unconscious conflicts from childhood.\n3. Cognitive psychologists would investigate how Tom's negative thought patterns contribute to his procrastination and low academic performance.\n4. The humanistic perspective would aim to assist Lisa in achieving her full potential by fostering personal growth and self-esteem.\n5.

A natural quasi-experiment involves the manipulation of independent variables by the researcher in a controlled environment to determine their effect on dependent variables.\n2. Naturalistic observation requires researchers to observe subjects in their natural environments without any interference or manipulation, thereby ensuring high ecological validity.\n3. Laboratory experiments allow researchers to control and manipulate variables precisely, which increases the internal validity of the study but may reduce its ecological validity.\n4. In a natural quasi-experiment, the independent variable is manipulated by the researcher to observe its effects on the dependent variable in a real-world setting.\n5.
